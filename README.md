# Funding Forecast: Leveraging Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis for Predictive Insights in Startup Investments

This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset that captures various aspects of startup funding dynamics. The dataset comprises several key features, including 'Organization Name', 'Founded Date', 'Number of Employees', 'Total Funding Amount', and 'Last Funding Amount', among others. The data spans multiple years and includes funding details in different currencies, providing a detailed view of financial inflows into startups.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and forecast the total funding amounts for startups, leveraging a range of regression and time series models. This involves understanding the historical funding patterns and predicting future trends based on the available data.
Key Context:
The dataset’s extensive historical records offer insights into funding trends over time, allowing for the evaluation of various predictive models. The analysis includes preprocessing the data to handle missing values and date formatting, feature engineering to enhance predictive power, and the application of sophisticated regression models to estimate funding amounts.

### Goals:
To preprocess and clean the dataset for analysis.
To evaluate the performance of different regression models.
To select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
To apply time series forecasting techniques to predict future funding trends.

### Business Impact:
Enhanced Decision-Making: Accurate funding forecasts can help investors and stakeholders make informed decisions regarding future investments.
Strategic Planning: Startups can leverage funding predictions to plan their growth strategies and resource allocation effectively.
Market Insights: Understanding funding trends provides valuable insights into market dynamics and investor behavior.

### Also, We will use and apply commonly used statistical tools and techniques and practice drawing insights:
* Examine the correlation of relevant variables and model this relationship using regression.
* Examine the same data using visualization techniques on Tableau or Excel.
* Regardless of the outcome of the analysis we will examine the results and use the insights in the final capstone project.

### NOTE: 
It is important to realize that you will be provided with a real dataset and required to do real work. More often than not, data analysis in the work scenario is meant to understand the context more deeply, demonstrate trends or patterns, and support decision-making. It is NOT a school statistics problem where there is an answer key and a prescribed approach to follow. You need to try and be resourceful and give this project your best shot.

Focus on finding and interpreting the patterns and trends (or the lack thereof) from the analysis, examine what that means for the relationships between variables, and draw reasonable conclusions about startups and funding rather than getting the "right answer".
