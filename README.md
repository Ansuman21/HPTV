# In this project, we will learn to use and apply commonly used statistical tools and techniques and practice drawing insights. We will:

* Examine the correlation of relevant variables and model this relationship using regression.
* Examine the same data using visualization techniques on Tableau or Excel.
* Regardless of the outcome of the analysis you will examine the results and use the insights in your final capstone project.

# NOTE: It is important to realize that you will be provided with a real dataset and required to do real work. More often than not, data analysis in the work scenario is meant to understand the context more deeply, demonstrate trends or patterns, and support decision-making. It is NOT a school statistics problem where there is an answer key and a prescribed approach to follow. You need to try and be resourceful and give this project your best shot.

Focus on finding and interpreting the patterns and trends (or the lack thereof) from the analysis, examine what that means for the relationships between variables, and draw reasonable conclusions about startups and funding rather than getting the "right answer".
